# Social-Trails

Social Trails is meant to be the first step towards a larger social media website geared towards past, present, and future travel.  Whether that be on a large scale, i.e. cross country road trip, or a short hike.

As a user, I want a single website where I can discuss, post, and potentially find new avenues of travel.

The website uses React on the front end, with graphQL for a server, and mongoose for our database.
